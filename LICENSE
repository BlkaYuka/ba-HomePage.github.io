== Fan Content Notice ==
This project contains fan-created, non-commercial content inspired by
Blue Archive (© NEXON Games Co., Ltd.).

All third-party intellectual property rights (characters, names, artwork,
logos, etc.) remain the property of their respective owners.

This license applies only to original code and media in this repository,
not to any third-party IP.

== Important Notes and Limitations ==
1. NonCommercial restriction:
   - All fan art, media, and derivative content in this repository is provided
     for non-commercial purposes only.
   - Commercial distribution (such as merchandise sales, paid downloads,
     or monetized services) is NOT permitted unless explicit prior permission
     is obtained from NEXON.

2. Code vs. Game IP:
   - The source code (HTML/CSS/JS) is under Apache License 2.0, which normally
     allows commercial use. However, if the code is used together with
     NEXON-owned IP (e.g., characters, artwork, trademarks), then commercial
     usage still requires prior written permission from NEXON.

3. Official Artwork:
   - If any official NEXON artwork is included under /assets/, its usage terms
     may be further restricted by NEXON’s official fan content guidelines.
     In such cases, the CC BY-NC 4.0 license does not override NEXON’s terms.

4. Policy Changes:
   - NEXON may update or change its fan content policy at any time.
     In case of conflict between this LICENSE and NEXON’s official guidelines,
     NEXON’s guidelines take precedence.

5. Unofficial Status:
   - This is an unofficial, fan-made project.  
   - It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by NEXON Games Co., Ltd.  
   - It must not be represented or perceived as an official NEXON service or website.

== Summary ==
- ✅ Free to share and remix for personal, non-commercial fan use
- ✅ Attribution required
- ❌ No commercial use without NEXON’s permission
- ❌ No claim of ownership over NEXON’s IP
- ❌ Not an official NEXON website
